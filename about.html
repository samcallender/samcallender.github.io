<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a digital marketer that recently relocated from Seattle WA back to the east coast and am living in Wilmington DE and Montclair NJ.  I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development while working working as a merchandising manager for Amazon in Seattle.  In this role I regularly worked with HTML and CSS to update customer facing content. However, without any formal Front-End Web Design training I was limited to editing and copying code written by my peers to update content on the pages I managed.</p>  

<p>I decided to take this course because I want to expand my technical skillset and I'm interested in possibly making major career change to become a web developer or UX designer.  I also really like making things I can show people and need a new hobby for my creative side.</p>

<h2>My Mission</h2>
<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to work in a digital marketing role at start-up or smaller company because I've only ever worked for two big Fortune 100 companies.  I want the next chapter of my career to be in a fast-paced small team where my work will have a very direct impact on the success of the company.  Having a strong front-end web design skillset will be a major asset in this type of environment and help me land my dream job.</p>
