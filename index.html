<h1>UNIT 2 Design Challenge</h1>

<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

<p>Two sites I really like are <a href="http://uber.com">Uber</a> and <a href="http://hbogo.com">HBO GO</a></p>

<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
<h3>Uber</h3>
<p>The Uber homepage uses effectively uses space by placing the site's most important call to action, &quot;Sign-Up For Uber&quot;, front and center and as the only above the fold information besides some navigation and log-in information on the periphery of the page.  Above the sig-up CTA, the site effectively uses size by using large font text for the service's value propositions to capture the user's attention.  Balance is used well throughout the homepage as users scroll through content below the fold.  Content transitions from single multi-column layouts seamlessly.  Transitions to new content sections are easy for users to identify as background imagery alternates from full-bleed photography to single color black or white backgrounds.</p>

<h3>HBO GO</h3>
<p>Space on the site is dominated by rotating anchor images to draw attention to featured content.  This is a media site so it makes sense to highlight the rich content the site offers using large captivating imagery.  Size is also used effectively to direct the user to featured content on the site to encourage users to flow towards this content.  Menu items are much smaller, but easy to locate so that users who are not interested in featured content can easily explore the rest of the site.  Finally, good balance is achieved by aligning menu items with the featured content imagery.</p>

<h2>What are the similarities and differences?</h2>
<h3>Similarities</h3>
<p>HBO and Uber use size similarly by prominently highlighting their featured content above the fold.  Menu and navigation content are minimized as much as possible so that users will gravitate towards the sign-up CTA with Uber or this week's featured content with HBO GO.</p>

<h3>Differences</h3>
<p>White space is used much differently between the two sites.  Uber's above the fold content is essentially just some value proposition messaging and a sign-button framed by a large amount of white space.   HBO GO keeps its featured content front and center, however menu options are located close by so that users can easily navigate to desired content.  The core difference between the sites that effects these design decisions is the expected frequency of use.  HBO GO is site that is intended to be used often by users while uber.com is really just a marketing site for their service that also provides some support and account management information.</p>

<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
<p>For my thumbnail sketches I decided to explore how I could apply some of the design principles used by Uber and HBO GO to redesign a website for my favorite neighborhood restaurant, <a href="http://rasasayangusa.com/">Rasa Sayang</a>.  As you can see, the restaurant's website is a bit dated</p>

<h3>Concept 1: Slpash Page With Navigation</h3>

<p>The first concept of the site is similar to HBO.  The homepage greets visitors with a large image with featured content such as dinner specials, happy hour specials etc.  Navigation is aligned directly below the main image so that users can navigate to different pages such as the restaurant menu, location and reservations.</p>

<p>For this version of the site I wanted to explore different ways to view the restaurant's lunch, dinner and drink menus.  These are depicted as figures A through E above.  I like D and E the best</p>

<h3>Concept 2: Single Scrolling Page</h3>

<p>For this second concept I reimagined what the entire site could be if it was a single flat scrolling page, broken into full page sections as users scroll down.  Site visitors are greated with large copy above the fold hovering above a call-to-action to make a reservation.  As visitors scroll down they move to a section linking to the three different menus, followed by location and contact information and finally an image gallery of the cuisine</p>
